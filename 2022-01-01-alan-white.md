In 2013 worked with Alan White, a blogger who was learning to create video games in his free time, to create an avatar based on his internet persona that he could use on social media.

After some initial sketches we decided to use the idea of holding the keyboard and I drafted a few different outfits based on descriptions from Alan.

After the initial character design, Alan contacted me for business cards and a Facebook cover photo.

Alan requested that his cat be included and that he be shown in 3 different states in the image. I drafted several ideas and Alan chose the ones he liked the best for the final piece.
