![Colorful illustration of two cats lounging on a shelf with books, a menorah, and a house plant.](http://www.danaamundsen.com/portfolio/client/pip_maus/pip_and_maus.png)

in 2021 the owner commissioned a portrait of their two cats, Pip and Maus, and I suggested adding some things from their home to make the image more personal. We decided to include their house plant, a Menorah, and some of the books from their shelves.

I provided 3 thumbnail sketches before proceeding with lineart and colors.
