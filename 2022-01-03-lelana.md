I was commissioned to create a logo for Lee of [Lelana Creations](https://www.facebook.com/LelanaCreations), a local seamstress who creates work with the 'help' of her two cats Nina and Lacey. I created this logo, inspired by a Miro piece that I saw at the Cincinnati Art Museum, for Lee to use as a tag on her creations and on social media.
