For [Louisville Magazine](https://louisville.com/) in June 2016. A group of artists were hired to illustrate the different neighborhoods of Louisville for a city guide issue of the magazine. I was hired to represent Butchertown, an area with restored Victorian fascades and many colorful small businesses.
