[Lady Knight](http://ladyknightcomic.tumblr.com) is a webcomic project that I started in 2014 and worked on through 2021. The comic was inspired by magical girl manga and Arthurian legends. It follows Tove, a mage who left home to pursue an academic life of study to lift her families status, and Merri a Knight trying to prove herself. The young women are accompanied by the mysterious unicorn Luca and the talking black cat Anka. They meet up with the princess of the kingdom, Jen, who is trying to escape the Kings Champion who has taken over rule from her sick father. The project is currently on haitus as I pursue other work.
