Last weekend I tabled at [Detroit Zine Fest](https://www.instagram.com/detzinefest/). I was supposed to be there with my friend and art partner [A.OK](https://aokvisualartist.com/) but she was unable to make it because of the snow the night before. If you follow me on instagram, or read my post [Long Distance Friends](https://www.danaamundsen.com/2023/02/19/ldf.html) you might have seen that Alex and I have been working together under the name [DnA Artists](https://www.dnaartists.net/). Our work is playful, cute, informative, and often has themes of friendship. We will be doing more events throughout the year and are looking into other ways to sell our art in case you are interested in supporting us.

Keep reading to see more pictures of what I brought to the fest and to hear my experience tabling!

I found out the night before that I would likely be doing the event solo. Alex and I had spend the last 2 months prepping for the event, prepping zines, setting up our website, instagram, and square for credit card processing. Alex built an [entire](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Co3HF6oDvpL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) [table display](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Co4vzHPjvky/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with her Dad over winter break that we were looking forward to setting up. On the other hand, I had some bookstands and a black table cloth, so in the end that was basically all I had for our table. I wrote some signs on cardstock the morning of the event and laid them out on the table for pricing in a feeble attempt to make shopping easier for attendees.

Despite my lackluster table set up, I ended up selling more than I had anticipated. I had set my expectations for this event pretty low, since it was my first one back after years of not selling at any art fests or conventions, and I was so happy with my sales at the end of the day. I was particularly excited to have sold my two metallic prints, which were a last minute addition. I wanted to have one higher priced item, something bigger or limited edition, or just unique, to give some variety to pricing and catch people's eyes as they were walking by. I didn't actually expect to sell them! People really seemed to relate to my *Coffee for a Ghost* print. I worried that it was too specific, as its based on a dream that I had about summoning a ghost by leaving out food for them. I guess we all have someone that we would like to sit and have coffee with one last time.

Everyone at the event was very kind and I had lots of great interactions with atendees and other artists. It was just the right size where you could walk through and see all the tables but not so small that you felt like you had to talk to everyone. There was a consistent flow of people from about noon onwards. The organizers were great, they really made the event feel like a safe space, and volunteers were available to help artists at all times. I particularly appreciated the quiet room and free coffee they provided. The Hero and Villian food truck was good too, I had a delicious vegetarian sandwich and some tasty seasoned waffle fries for lunch.

I have lots of memories associated with the Detroit suburbs. My mom grew up there and we drove there regularly to see family all throughout my childhood. My mom drove up to Detroit with me to see our family, but was kind enough to help me with the table since Alex couldn't make it. I think she had fun, though, because she did end up talking to a few of the artists and buying some things. The next day she even confessed that she wished she had bought more! My family all asked about the event the next day and I have to say it was really nice to hear their words of support. I'm grateful to have a family that encourages me to make my art.

Alex and I are taking a bit of time to breath this week but will be making plans for our next event in May soon. We are attending Halftone Zinefest in Lexington, KY on May 13th. We've got lots of ideas for new zines and other practical art pieces!
