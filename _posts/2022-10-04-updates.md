Just a few updates:

- I've been active on [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/danaamundsen). All of my new work will *always* be posted here first, but I am planning to share some older work there and I post there much more regularly and share some personal moments as well.
- I've opened a [Ko-fi](http://www.ko-fi.com/danaamundsen). I've got some 3d models and also a digital zine up for sale, and I have more ideas/plans that I'm not quite ready to share because I know they will take time to get everything going.
- I am accepting [Character Commissions](/commissions/). The commissions are all full color and start at just $50. You can choose to add characters, an animal companion, or a simple background for a higher price. I look forward to drawing your characters!

That's all for now. I will be sharing some new work here soon.

Until then,  
Dana
