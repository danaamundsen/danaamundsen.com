Reimagined versions of Tove and Merri from my webcomic [Lady Knight](http://ladyknightcomic.tumblr.com).

I put them in more 19th century clothing instead of the Medieval or High Fantasy styles that they usually wear. This was just a bit of fun illustration for me at the end of 2022. I wanted to try doing some more traditional style art, so I drew this in pencil and ink on smooth mixed media paper. I actually watercolored it afterward, but the results were not great so I'm going to keep that to myself.

I scanned the drawing and then did some edits and added screentones in Clip Studio. I recently learned how to do add screentones and now I'm kind of obsessed and want to do a whole comic with screen tones. I added the lace in the background to really up the classic manga vibes. I grew up reading Shoujo Manga so this is just me indulging in the nostalgia.
