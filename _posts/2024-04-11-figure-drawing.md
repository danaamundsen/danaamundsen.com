Last week I attended a figure drawing class for the first time in... over a decade!? The alst time I was in a figure drawing session was when I was in undergrad. I have been interested in adding them back into my art practice. I found this drawing and art center last year but was too intimidated to attend any of the classes. They had an open house last month and I asked a friend to attend with me, who is also an artist. We comiserated on our trauma from art school (lol) but also what we missed about being in art school.

After the open house, we both felt more comfortable attending a drawing session. We went together, for solidarity, and we both had a great time. The session was 2 hours long, and the long drawing, shown here, was a majority of that time. I am happy with the drawing, part of me was really anxious and worried that I would absolutely bomb the first time I tried life drawing again. I feel like there is still a lot of opportunity for growth and my friend and I want to go back, maybe once a month.
