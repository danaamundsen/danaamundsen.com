Time for some updates about [DnA](https://www.dnaartists.net/)! [Alex](https://aokvisualartist.com/) and I have been working on prepping orders for the DnA 2023 Bundle, which includes a t-shirt designed by myself, a sticker designed by Alex, and both of our Sketchbook zines from 2023. The preorder window for the bundle has closed and the tshirts are no longer available but the sticker and sketchbook zines are both still for sale on our online shop. You can read more about the bundle on [the DnA blog](https://www.dnaartists.net/2024/01/25/dna-2023-bundle.html).

Which yes, I didn't announce it here, but [you can now purchase my work online](https://dna-artists.square.site/)! Currently zines and stickers are all available in our online shop, and we are planning to offer prints and other items online in the future. Please consider ordering as it directly supports my work!
