Time for some updates about [DnA Artists](https://www.dnaartists.net/), an artist duo including myself and A.OK! [Alex](https://aokvisualartist.com/) and I have been working on prepping orders for the DnA 2023 Bundle, which includes a t-shirt designed by myself, a sticker designed by Alex, and both of our Sketchbook zines from 2023. The preorder window for the bundle has closed and the tshirts are no longer available but the sticker and sketchbook zines are both still for sale on our online shop. You can read more about the bundle on [the DnA blog](https://www.dnaartists.net/2024/01/25/dna-2023-bundle.html).

Which yes, I didn't announce it here, but [you can now purchase my work online](https://dna-artists.square.site/)! Currently zines and stickers are available in our online shop, and we are planning to offer prints and other items online in the future. Please consider ordering as it directly supports my work!

We are also getting ready for 2024 zine events. I am working on a 16 page comic, which you can learn more about in my [previous blog post](https://www.danaamundsen.com/2024/02/01/comic-wip.html)https://www.danaamundsen.com/2024/02/01/comic-wip.html, along with restocking all of my cat related zines and making some new ones as well. We are hoping that this year we can both focus on some longer and more indepth projects while still publishing smaller mini zines. Running the business is a learning process, and we definitely learned a lot in our first year.

Here's to another successful year of DnA! Cheers!
