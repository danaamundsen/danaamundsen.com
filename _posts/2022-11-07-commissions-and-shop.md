I am offering digital and watercolor pet portraits for the holidays. Digital prints are $50, 8x10 printed and shipped via PrintKeg. Watercolor portraits are $75 dollars, 8x10 painted on watercolor paper with lightfast paint.
There are 10 slots available for each type, and they will be open until December 31st. Commissions can be ordered on my Ko-fi.

I've also opened an online shop, currently selling cat zines and washi tape.
