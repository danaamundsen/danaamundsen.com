![a digital painting of elend venture in his white uniform with a black cloak. the sky is red and ash is falling. he is backlit by the orange and red sun and mist flows around him. the painting has a very crisp and illustrated style with flatter colors and dramatic lighting.](/assets/img/post/2022/2022-07-18-elend-final.png)

*i love unrealistic dramatic lighting*

i finished the first three mistborn books and i wanted to draw elend in his white uniform. i tried adding his beard, but i didn't like the way it looked. i should have incorporated it from the start, that was my mistake. i'm still getting back into using color and i'm not sure how successful this is as a whole but there are some things that i really like, like the hair and the glow on his face.
