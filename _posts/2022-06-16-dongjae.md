![head studies of seo dong jae in various styles. also some drawings of hwang si-mok in a cute style with cat ears.](http://www.icefairy.net/artlog/2022-06-12-stranger-sketches.png)

i struggle to adapt live action characters into a consistent style for drawing, so i am trying to practice and see what sticks. stranger is one of my favorite shows so i would really like to be able to draw fanart of it!
