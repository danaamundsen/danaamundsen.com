i was drawing a fan comic and wanted to put the characters in historical dress when i realized that i don't really know that much about historical dress. so, i browsed [the met's digital collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/the-collection) and picked a few pieces to draw. there were so many great pieces that i had a hard time choosing. i'll definitely be using the digital collection again for inspiration.
