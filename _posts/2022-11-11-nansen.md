Nansen, the ship's cat aboard the *Belgica*. She was named after Fridtjof Nansen, the Nowegian Arctic explorer. Me being me, I knew that I wanted to pay homage to her in Frostbite. I can imagine her wandering around the ship in the background and curling up on the sailor's laps for warmth. 

I'm reading *Roald Amundsen's Belgica Diariy* as research for Frostbite and I was very happy to see a drawing of Nansen by the cabin boy and Amundsen has written once about her in his diary as well.
