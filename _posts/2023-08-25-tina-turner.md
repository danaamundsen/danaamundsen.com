I recently completed two comic pages for Paul Harrill of [Self-Reliant Film](https://www.selfreliantfilm.com/). The comic is an autobio peice about his first time seeing Tina Turner live, and a tribute to her influence in his life.

Paul reached out to me because he was interested in exploring making comics and graphic novels. I agreed to produce some comic pages for him, and the process went very smoothly. I enjoyed working from his script and he gave lots of great feedback as I worked.

I was familiar with Tina Turner, but hadn't spent much time learning about her before this project. I watched performances and collected images of her in Bob Mackie dresses on pinterest for reference. I was a bit intimidated trying to capture her incredible stage presence and energy. I don't think I quite nailed it, but I am happy with how the pages turned out, and her appearance is definitely the highlight.

Keep reading to hear about the process behind drawing the pages, and some process gifs.
