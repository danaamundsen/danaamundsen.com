![a comic page: panel 1- A girl leans over an intricate wrought iron balcony rail overlooking a large room; panel 2- Close up we can see that she is Vin, with short dark hair and a ball gown. She is startled by someone saying "Now, see, here's the problem with going to refill your cup of wine"; panel 3- she turns to see a man, who continues, "You return to find that your favorite spot has been stolen by a pretty girl."; panel 4- elend venture stands with a book in his jacket pocket and holding a glass of wine. " Now, a gentleman would move on to another place, leaving the lady to her contemplations," he says, "However, this is the best spot on the balcony--it's the only place close enough to a lantern to have good reading light."](http://www.icefairy.net/artlog/2022-07-01-vin-elend-meetcute.png)

I've been reading the [mistborn books by brandon sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-mistborn-saga-the-original-trilogy/) and i wanted to draw the scene where vin and elend met. not emblematic of the series at all really but i could just see how i wanted to draw it so i did! i had fun imaginging the world and characters, although i don't think i was able to capture it that well. i have more ideas and hope that i can share some more drawings of them in the future.

i spent *way* too long on this. i got carried away in details on panel one and then didn't want to finish the rest. i redrew their outfits because the first pass was just so lazy. then i redid the lettering because i decided i didn't like the font i chose. ultimately i'm still not satisfied with it but i just want it to be done and published so that i can move on.

it's frustrating because i used to whip stuff like this out so quickly! but i'm always learning. and i did spend a lot of time on the first panel trying to build a believable environment so that the rest of the page would feel like it had a 'place.'
