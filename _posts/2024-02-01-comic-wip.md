I've been hard at work on a new comic project, currently untitled, but featuring some familiar faces. If you have been following my work for a long time, or have done some digging, you have probably seen my [Lady Knight webcomic](https://ladyknightcomic.tumblr.com/). I also tend to reference it and talk about it kind of a lot. I'm reviving the characters to write a 16 page romance comic, and hopefully have it ready to sell at zine fests and in the DnA online shop this summer.
