If you have been following me for a while, you may be familiar with [my *Waiter Cat* zine](https://danaamundsen.tumblr.com/post/666498484635156480/i-made-a-lil-zine-about-a-cat-that-waits-tables). I wrote it in roughly 2016 and drew it in 2020, a time when I was not very active on social media. The zine proved to be relatively popular at Detroit ZineFest, so I have decided to expand it into a series called *Working Cat*. *Working Cat* is a series about my work history, told through the lens of a cat tolerating different jobs. In the zines Cat can be seen ignoring customers and co-workers, sleeping, and stealing from the workplace. And she doesn't care!

I have a tenuous relationship with wage labour. The jobs I tend to be most successful at, and most comfortable doing, are jobs where I render services or goods for customers, and these jobs tend to be low paid hourly wage jobs. I have tried venturing into office jobs, lured by the promise of health insurance and paid time off, but have never found any satisfaction in them. I am still struggling to find a solution to the problem of work and pay that suits my lifestyle, and these humorous zines are a way for me to playfully contemplate work and my relationship to it.

This zine, along with *Waiter Cat* will be available for purchase at Halftone ZineFest in Lexington, KY on May 13th, 2023.
