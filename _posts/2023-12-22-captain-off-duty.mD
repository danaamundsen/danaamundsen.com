a drawing from much earlier this year, this is Merriwyn Captain of the Royal Gaurd, possibly tipsy after her evening shift.

I am still working on a short comic about Merri, Tove, and Jen, as a kind of conclusion to their character arcs that never even really got started in Lady Knight. This sketch is in relation to that new story, with a new setting, new designs, and new romance.
