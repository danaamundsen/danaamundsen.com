i love it when the lady pulls up her gown to reveal a concealed weapon!! <3

i loved steris from the moment that she handed wax that marriage contract. i'm so glad that she featured more in bands of mourning, and i love her dyanmic with wax. i wasn't sure if they were going to end up together at first and i'm so so glad that they did!

i wanted to give her a kind of early 1900's gibson girl type vibe, so i looked at gowns from that time period for inspiration on the silhouette and undergarments. i started to color this but since it's just a character sketch i didn't think about the setting and lighting when i was conceptualizing it and it just wasn't working to force it.
