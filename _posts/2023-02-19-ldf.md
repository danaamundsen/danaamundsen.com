A cute 4 panel comic that I made for my first zine fest with my friend [A.OK](https://aokvisualartist.com/) for our new collaboration [DnA Artists](https://www.dnaartists.net/).

This comic is inspired by my friendship with Alex. We've always found ways to stay in touch, even when we lived in different coutries. This comic is dedicated to that friendship.

Alex and I have been friends since art school and have been supporting each other's creative work since we first met. After graduating we attended a few Comic Book and Anime conventions around Kentucky, sharing a table to cut down on costs. We didn't make any money, but we had fun and both of us learned a lot.

Last year, we started toying with the idea of re-entering the world of conventions and festivals but as zinesters this time. We both had some work that we could sell at the table, and we had lots of ideas for collaborative projects. We've also both been researching how to run your own business and looking for more opportunities to travel and see each other. Everything started to come together, and now we are ready for our first zine fest.

Our first event will be [Detroit Zine Fest](https://www.dnaartists.net/events/detroit-zine-fest.html) on March 4th. I will be selling this print, along with my cat related zines, a sketchbook zine, and more. We will be attending more events later in the year, and all updates will be posted on our [website](https://www.dnaartists.net/) and our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dna.artists/).
