I read The Secret History by Donna Tartt and loved it. There were passages that I reread over and over, the book really transported me. I decided to try using some of the techniques I learned in *Drawing the Head and Hands* by Andrew Loomis to try to capture the characters. Just some quick sketches. I particularly like how the profile of Henry turned out. I know that profiles can oten look very flat, but I think that's kind of what I like about them. They are very graphic.
