I sketched these portraits of Oak and Suren in my sketchbook and I wanted to do something with them. I had a few different ideas and aborted attempts at coloring them or compositing them into an illustration together, but ultimately I decided to just give them a manga vibe with screentones. I'm having fun experimenting with them and I think it compliments the simply lineart well.

See the sketches without screentones and read more about my thoughts on the book below the read more.

I am a huge fan of Holly Black's books, and I snatched up a copy of *The Stolen Heir* as soon as I could from my public library. The book was too short! I didn't realize it was going to be a two part series. I read it so quickly and then I was sad it was over. I don't think that anyone could ever supplant Jude and Cardan as my OTP but I do enjoy Wren and Oak and I am very curious to see how their story turns out. I love feral monster girls and pretty princes.
