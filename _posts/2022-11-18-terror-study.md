I watched AMC's *The Terror* and took some screenshots to do studies. I'm trying to workout how to render ice and snow, so I'm doing studies each morning. I start with two 5 min, then two 10 min and then a final 30 minute study. This is the best I've come out with so far.

I don't consider myself a true 'painter', because I rely very heavily on line. I initialy tried to do just shapes but it wasn't working out for me, so now I'm trying to hybridize the two by incorporating a sketch into the final 'painting.' I am making progress, it's just frustrating because most of the studies I do look absolutely terrible to me. I guess that's part of the process.

Reference and timelapse under the cut.
