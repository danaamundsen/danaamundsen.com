Ending the year with a work in progress. I started this a while back and don’t know if it will ever be successfully finished. These characters are close to me personally and while I want to share them I don’t want to speak too candidly about them at the moment. I’m still exploring their story and for now I’m just enjoying drawing them.

2023 was a year of fresh starts. My biggest accomplishment was opening my business, [DnA Artists](https://www.dnaartists.net/), with my long time work partner A.OK. We attended 5(!) zine fests, opened an online storefront, and consigned our work to two zine shops. It’s been hard work, and I don’t think I could have done it without the support of A.OK and our family and friends. This has been a long held dream of mine, to own my own business and to support myself off of my art. We are just getting started and I’m optimistic that we can build a sustainable business. If you are interested in supporting me, please consider [subscribing to our newsletter](https://pencilbooth.com/dna/) to get updates about where we will be and new releases in [our online shop](https://dna-artists.square.site/).

In 2023, I (re?)established my own website, which you are reading this blog post from now. I wanted to break away from the grind of social media and keep my work somewhere safe from the whims of big tech and advertisers. Speaking of, I left twitter and created a mastodon account. Was that really just this year? Limiting my social media usage has been a boon for my mental health and freed up time and space for other things.

Outside of my art practice, I began to examine my relationship with shopping and consumerism. I watched many of [Hannah Poston’s](https://www.youtube.com/@HannahLouisePoston) vlogs on her no-buy year and was inspired to try my own no-buy month. I even made [a zine](https://dna-artists.square.site/product/no-buy/44?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=6) about it! It was a great experience and I am planning to take what I learned into my budgeting for 2024.

[I read a lot of books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/danaamundsen), but didn’t quite hit my goal of 75 for the year. That’s okay, I like to have something to work toward for next year. This list includes graphic novels, poetry, and some novella’s so the number 75 doesn’t really signify much. It was just a goal to get me to pick up more books.

I continued trail running, backpacking, and camping. I ran a sub 30 minute 5k which was not explicitly a goal, but definitely something I’m proud of. I revamped my weight training routine to support my other health goals.

Currently I am ending the year with a bout of covid, not the most optimistic way to go out. But overall the year has been good to me. I am looking forward to 2024 and hoping that it brings more good things to me, and to you. I’ll share my goals in the next post.

Happy New Year!
