Alex and I over at DnA Artists have been working on a new series of informative zines we are calling 'Dabble' zines (currently under debate, but this is the working title for now). The zines are a way for us to explore and share information on topics that we are interested in and that we think would be helpful to other zinesters, creative people, and artists. My first contribution to the Dabble series is some zines on the Open Web.

Currently there are 2 zines available in the set, *What is the Open Web?* co-authored by Mike Amundsen, my dad and a well known API architect, and *What is RSS?*. These zines are small and short, meant to be simply a starting point for people to learn more about the topics.

Continue reading to hear about the style and process of the zines, and see some of the art from the interior.

For these zines, we chose to do a more traditional black and white collage style. Usually my work is very illustrative, but we wanted to focus to be on the text and information on the zine rather than the art work. I think the collage style also suits the diy aesthetic of the series. These are some examples of the style of collage inside the zines.

I also chose to include screentones and word balloons to introduce some comic elements to the layouts as well. Overall, I think the zines are very accessible ways for others to get started learning about the Open Web.
